           <h1> Inventors & People as Data</h1> 
           <li>Filter the list of inventors for those who were born in the 1500's = Array Filter</li> 
           <li>Give us an array of the inventors' first and last names = Array Map</li> 
           <li>Sort the inventors by birthdate, oldest to youngest = Array Sort</li> 
           <li>How many years did all the inventors live? = Array Reduce</li> 
           <li>Sort the inventors by years lived = Array Sort</li> 
           <li>Create a list of Boulevards in Paris that contain 'de' anywhere in the name
            From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Boulevards_in_Paris = Array Filter</li>
           <li>Sort the people alphabetically by last name = Array Sort </li> 
           <li>Sum up the instances of each of these =  Reduce Exercise </li>
